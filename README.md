# Poor Man's Reddit with Lightbox

This is a jQuery project using the Reddit API and lightbox.  
To run, just double click on the index.html file.  
The titles are links to open the images or videos in a seperate window.  
If you click on the images, they will open in lightbox if they are compatible.
